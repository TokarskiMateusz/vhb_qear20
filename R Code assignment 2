### This is the script for importing, labeling and briefly summarizing insolvencies filings in Germany from July 1st to August 18th.
#The .csv is publicly available at the Github reporsitory of Joachim Gassen or at the original source https://www.insolvenzbekanntmachungen.de

#Packages required to run the code. 
#Only run this once, the packages will remain installed on your local R. Mainly base R and data.table functions are used.
#install.packages("data.table")
library(data.table)
#install.packages("expss")
library(expss)

## Import Insolvency Data 2020
insolvencies <- read.csv2("raw_data/insolvency_filings_de_julaug2020_incomplete.csv", sep = ",", encoding = "UTF-8") #Encoding UTF-8 to treat Umlaute.
#View(insolvencies) # Display Data in RStudio



## Simple data datea cleanse
#Transform dataset from data.frame to data.table
insolvencies <- as.data.table(insolvencies)

# Count number of rows that contain NA values in any column.
nrow(insolvencies) - nrow(insolvencies[complete.cases(insolvencies), ]) # count all rows - rows without NA values
# The analysis shows no missing values. We have 10 035 observations of 6 variables.

# Treat strucutre of insolvencies
str(insolvencies) # structure of insolencies
insolvencies$date <- as.Date(insolvencies$date)
str(insolvencies)

# Remove dublicates
nrow (insolvencies) - nrow(unique(insolvencies)) #display number of duplicate rows
insolvencies <- unique(insolvencies)

# Apply labels for nicer column names
insolvencies = apply_labels(insolvencies,
                    date = "Date of Insolvency Filing",
                    insolvency_court = "Court Location",
                    court_file_number = "File Number in Court",
                    subject = "Subject",
                    name_debtor = "Name of Debtor",
                    domicile_debtor = "Debtor Domicile"
)



## Create summary tables of different data characteristics
# Number of Subjects
Subject <- insolvencies[, .N, by = "subject"]
Subject <- Subject[order(Subject$N, decreasing = T),] 

# Domicile of Court
CourtLocation <- insolvencies[, .N, by = "insolvency_court"]
CourtLocation <- CourtLocation[order(CourtLocation$N, decreasing = T),] 


## Time distribution
Date <- insolvencies[, .N, by = "date"]
Date <- Date[order(Date$N, decreasing = T),] 
plot(Date$date, Date$N, type = "l", xlab = "Date", ylab = "Observations") # display time distribution


### Conclusion:
On the first of July, insolvensies where the highest. One could filter for weekdays(), as it seems that the offices sometimes 
work on saturdays which leads to a drop in observations.
